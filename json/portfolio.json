			"description": "In <i>Le Violon d'Lisa</i>, a nichrome wire attached on a cello bow is programmed to create sound when it touches a performer’s body. When the bow is in contact with a skin, the data is being collected then calibrated into sound with using Arduino, Max/MSP, and Ableton Live. The performance was inspired by Manray’s photograph of Le Violon d’Ingres to be created into a performance.",

			"description": "For this project, I'm using heart rate sensor(Polar wear link & transmitter). When my heart rate goes faster, a pitch of the sound will begin to go down and speed will start to slow down. The sound is a narration of the story of a young artist who has a tragic end because of the amount of pressure she received from the people. The story is called Depth Wish written by Patrick Suskind’s (the author of ‘Perfume’) “Three stories and a reflection”. I read this book when I was 18 and it was very memorable. I recorded my voice in both Korean and English and this will be played as performance begins.",

			"description": "There are many layers of information implied by looking at the documentation of a person, whether by portrait paintings or photography. I think portraiture (highly depictive enough to distinguish a person) is a reflection of the person’s identity, documenting characteristics of class, gender, age, and race. I approached the portraits in a non-realistic way by depicting a person as a disguised face image sectioned into patterns. I was heavily motivated to produce this series of paintings after four years of living in California. A sharp contrast to living in a homogenous country like Korea, California and its influences of interacting, diverse peoples has become crucial part of my art practice.",

Inside a limousine, hundreds of marshmallows were installed and I had a critique with my classmates for about an hour. In the beginning, everyone was excited at creating a festive atmosphere. But being crowded with 14 people in a restricted space, the stickiness of melted marshmallows and overwhelming smells made us feel uncomfortable as time goes by.",
