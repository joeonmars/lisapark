A nichrome wire attached on a cello bow creates sound when it touches a performer's body by calibrating the data into a melody. Since body is conductive, skin becomes a new interfaces for musical expression.",

			"description": "For this project, I'm using heart rate sensor(Polar wear link & transmitter). When my heart rate goes faster, a pitch of the sound will begin to go down and speed will start to slow down. The sound is a narration of the story of a young artist who has a tragic end because of the amount of pressure she received from the people. The story is called Depth Wish written by Patrick Suskind’s (the author of ‘Perfume’) “Three stories and a reflection”. I read this book when I was 18 and it was very memorable. I recorded my voice in both Korean and English and this will be played as performance begins.",

			"description": "Inspired by the notion of relational aesthetics, my intent was to create a space where everyone can participate and experience the moment. I chose marshmallows because I associate them with playful childhood memories through their soft texture and sweet smells. Inside a limousine, hundreds of marshmallows were installed and I had a critique with my classmates for about an hour. In the beginning, everyone was excited at creating a festive atmosphere. But being crowded with 14 people in a restricted space, the stickiness of melted marshmallows and overwhelming smells made us feel uncomfortable as time goes by.",
